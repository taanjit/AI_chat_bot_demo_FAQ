Check the validity of your SIM card to ensure your subscription hasn\\'t expired. Confirm that your SIM\\'s service is still active to avoid any disruptions.\\n\\n## 3. Check Power and Connectivity:\\n\\n1. Ensure the edge device is powered on and connected to the network.\\n2. Verify that all cables are securely connected and there are no loose connections.\\n4. LED Indicators: Check if the LED status lights on the gateway are steady.\\n5. Power Cycle: Unplug the gateway (modem), wait for 10 minutes then plug it back in. This can resolve many temporary issues.\\n6. If none of the above solutions work, please contact customer care via mail -id: netvire.support@thinkpalm.com .\\n\\n## 3. Data not updating in the connected Devices:\\n\\n1. Check the gateway is up or down in the gateway page.\\n2. Check the signal status and battery Health.\\n3. Check the device last updated time and date.\\n4. Check for any network outages or disruptions.\\n5. If the issue persists after troubleshooting, it may be a device-specific or firmware issue. Contact customer support for further assistance via mailid: netvire.support@thinkpalm.com. They will be able to provide firmware updates, advanced troubleshooting, or a hardware replacement.\\n\\n## 4. Events not triggering in Events page:\\n\\n1. Check the Gateway up or down.\\n2. Check the device status.\\n3. Check the Events rules settings to ensure it is configured to trigger the events. (make sure correct device is selected in the event rule condition).\\n4. Check that event repeat interval is blank if so, open event will not repeat.\\n5. Check if the threshold levels (temperature, humidity, CO2, etc.) are set correctly for triggering the alarm.\\n\\n6. Ensure that there is no interference that could be disrupting the communication between the devices system and the dashboard (e.g., WiFi interference, physical obstructions).\\n7. Ensure that environmental conditions (like lighting or temperature) aren\\'t preventing proper detection for sensor.\\n8. The alarm is still not triggering the dashboard, contact the customer support team via mail -id: netvire.support@thinkpalm.com .\\n\\n## 5. Report Not Generating correctly:\\n\\n1. Check the start end time of the report.\\n2. Verify that the devices or sensors are operational and transmitting data.\\n3. Check the filters or criteria set for the report. If the filters are too restrictive (e.g., an incorrect date range, specific sites, or user permissions), the report might fail to generate.\\n4. For instant report will only be generated for events occurring within the specified date range.\\n5. Review User Permissions to ensure the correct access rights for generating reports.\\n6. Clear Cache or Refresh the dashboard and test again.\\n7. If none of the above solutions work, please contact customer care via mail -id: netvire.support@thinkpalm.com .\\n\\n## Maintenance\\n\\n- Check Sensor Placement for obstructions and correct positioning.\\n- Clean the Sensors with a soft cloth or compressed air.\\n- Inspect and Replace Batteries as needed.\\n- Test Sensor Functionality by manually triggering the sensor and checking for response.\\n- Update Firmware/Software to keep sensors running efficiently.\\n- Check for Obstructions/Interference that could affect performance.Monitor Signal Strength (for wireless sensors) and eliminate any interference.\\n- Inspect for Physical Wear and Tear or damage and replace faulty components.')"
